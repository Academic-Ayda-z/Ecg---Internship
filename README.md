# Ecg---Internship
Cardiac arrhythmia Detection from Ecg test using signal and image processing

I am being supervised by both professor Gholamreza Karimi and Associate Professor Zohre Azimifar at Shiraz University.

Report of What I have done :

made the source code of [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-heart-arrhythmias-with-deep-learning-in-keras-with-dense-cnn-and-lstm-add337d9e41f) run without any error.(which used [wfdb](https://physionet.org/content/wfdb-python/4.1.0/) )

Read https://physionet.org/content/ecg-fragment-high-risk-label/1.0.0/ to undrestand the data base([paper pdf link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1COB_y73jNy_6JlL_2GeeZF37AjLmUvhn/view?usp=share_link))and visualized some of the in [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gTstRn_Nq08Zk5gSuRHewYVE85lwDqeQ?usp=share_link).
